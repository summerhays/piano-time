For beginners, it's hard to find music that is interesting but also at the right level.

Most music is either easy or interesting, but not both (and sometimes neither).

##### I have a few resources I like to recommend for beginners: 

* My favorite book for this is from the [Dozen a Day](https://www.halleonard.com/product/158307/a-dozen-a-day-anthology) series by Edna Mae Burnam, any one of them is fine.

* Once the student in managing to fly through those pieces, one of my favourite books quite vintage, but still excellent, [Keyboard Frolics by John Thompson](https://www.amazon.com/Keyboard-Frolics-First-Studies-Velocity/dp/B000R07308).

* Finally, there is an excellent Canadian series on how to play piano for free by [Andrew Furmanczyk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vphWgqbF-AM) (worth clicking just to see his hair).
