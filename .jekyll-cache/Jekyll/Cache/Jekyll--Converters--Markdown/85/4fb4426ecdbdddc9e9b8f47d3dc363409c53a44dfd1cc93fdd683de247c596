<blockquote>
  <p>For a long time, playing piano was stressful and frustrating. Now, I can focus on my love of music.
I‚Äôve had a half dozen teachers in the past; they were excellent but they were unable to meet me where I was. Within only a few months, David helped me understand what was blocking me. 
My playing is at a new level now: He has helped me learn how to coordinate my hands, how to read chords in spite of dyslexia, how to play without risk of injury. But perhaps the most striking is my attitude, how relaxed and happy I feel at the keyboard, like everything just flows.
I have years of experience working with smart people with learning disabilities; in fact, I have learning disabilities. David is extremely gifted. He helps me view piano music in a new exciting way that makes sense to me.</p>
