<ul>
  <li>
    <p>My favorite book for this is from the <a href="https://www.halleonard.com/product/158307/a-dozen-a-day-anthology">Dozen a Day</a> series by Edna Mae Burnam, any one of them is fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the student in managing to fly through those pieces, one of my favourite books quite vintage, but still excellent, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keyboard-Frolics-First-Studies-Velocity/dp/B000R07308">Keyboard Frolics by John Thompson</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, there is an excellent Canadian series on how to play piano for free by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vphWgqbF-AM">Andrew Furmanczyk</a> (worth clicking just to see his hair).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
