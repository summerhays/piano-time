<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

<p>I focus on making piano <em>easy</em> and on <em>natural learning</em>. My philosophy is that if you present a clear physical and cognitive “puzzle” to the body, there is no need to practice (though it doesn’t hurt): the subconscious will solve the puzzle “naturally” within a couple of days. I honestly worry more about my students practicing <em>too much</em> than practicing too little. That is the power of puzzle-based learning, powered by asking questions and directing awareness to problem solving.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-lessons-like-for-beginners">What are lessons like for beginners?</h2>

<p>I propose musical and whimsical music that is at the right level (see <a href="/resources">Resources</a>).</p>

<p>For beginners, my philosophy is that it’s important to have a “breezy” attitude about music at the beginning. For my students, I use a lot of what I call “<abbr title="disposable">burner</abbr> music,” fairly easy music that we fly through over the course of about a month. So rather than investing too much in learning a couple of pieces at the beginning, I much prefer to try a bunch of little, easy, one or two line songs that are cute, and move onto something else.</p>
